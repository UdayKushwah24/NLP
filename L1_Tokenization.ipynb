It allows computers to understand human language. Tokenization is the first step in processing text data. It splits the text into smaller parts such as sentences or words. These tokens help models learn patterns and meanings. Without tokenization, analyzing text becomes difficult. Developers use various libraries like NLTK and spaCy for this task. With proper tokenization, even complex language tasks become manageable.\"\"\""
